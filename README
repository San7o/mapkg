Installation
------------

Clone this repo in your filesystem and set the environment variable
`MAPKG_PATH` to that position (by default, "$HOME/mapkg" is used). You
will use `mapkg.sh` to manage your packages, you should add it's
location to your path. The packages will be installed in
`MAPKG_PATH/bin` so you should add this to your path aswell:

   export MAPKG_PATH="$HOME/mapkg"
   export PATH="$MAPKG_PATH:$MAPKG_PATH/bin:$PATH"


Repository structure
--------------------

All build scripts (that will be referred to as `maps`) are stored in a
tree structure under `maps/` with the following structure:

  - maps
     - category
        - package
           - version

For example, `gcc-14.1` would be found in:

  - maps
    - dev
      - gcc
        - 14.1.0

The location of the map is `MAPKG_PATH`/maps. By default this is `~/mapkg/maps`.


Maps
----

Each map contains an sh script which implements the following functionalities:

- list of dependencies
- download
- installation
- clean the build
- remove
- metadata: description and other things

The output of the installation can be found in `MAPKG_PATH`/bin.


Updates
-------

Maps are updated via git by fetching this repository, either
using a known tag or from master branch.
